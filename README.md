This is my reflection and final project in this course

#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

The key to understanding user needs is to first engage with the user to gain a better understanding of their expectations. While gathering this information, we also determine the reasons behind these requests and the order in which to prioritize them. Once all this information is collected, effective user stories can be written in the format: “As an {end-user}, I want to {some request} so that {reason}.” These stories should be prioritized by importance so that we know which features should be implemented first. Creating user stories helps keep the team focused on exactly what the user wants and sets clear guidelines for what must be true for a feature to be considered complete.

#How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

The way I approach developing any program is by first breaking down the problem into smaller parts and identifying the dependencies between those parts. Next, I write out pseudocode and then develop and test each incremental part one by one until it meets the requirements. An Agile process I hope to incorporate into my future projects is retrospectives. Reflecting on what worked well and what didn’t can help me identify issues that I might not be immediately aware of when completing similar tasks in future projects. I find this process very valuable because it can help speed up future development time.

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member in software development involves a combination of technical skills, communication, collaboration, and a positive attitude. Some important characteristics include effective communication, collaboration, adaptability, and reliability. Effective communication ensures that ideas and feedback are articulated clearly, reducing misunderstandings. Collaboration with team members is crucial, as it involves working together and sharing knowledge, which improves problem-solving and strengthens team rapport. Adaptability means being open to and embracing change, which is essential in a fast-paced development environment. Finally, being reliable and accountable involves meeting deadlines and communicating challenges as they arise to help keep the team on track.
